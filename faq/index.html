<h2 id="what-data-is-featured-on-this-website">What data is featured on this website?</h2>

<p>Open Disclosure visualizes campaign finance data for Oakland candidates and ballot measures. The data comes from the City’s <a href="https://public.netfile.com/pub2/Default.aspx?aid=COAK">campaign finance portal</a> on the City of Oakland Public Ethics Commission website.</p>

<p>The data collected by the Public Ethics Commission is required by the  California <a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/the-law/the-political-reform-act.html">Political Reform Act (PRA)</a>, which requires that a candidate or campaign committee that plans to raise or spend $2,000 or more in a calendar year—including the candidate’s personal funds—must file statements and reports on the committee’s financial activity at specified periods. Candidates or campaign committees that do not raise or spend $2,000 or more in a calendar year are not required to report their financial activity electronically, which may result in some candidates with no available public financial data.</p>

<p>Campaign finance data is self-reported by all local candidate-controlled and ballot measure committees. Our volunteer team does not clean, scrub, or edit the data. If there are misspellings or duplicate entries, then that was how the committee reported the campaign finance data. The data is presented as reported. Where necessary we may aggregate data that we believe represents the same entity.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-data-come-from">Where does the data come from?</h2>

<p>The campaign finance data that Open Disclosure presents is derived primarily from the filings of the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) <a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Forms/460.pdf">Form 460</a> (Recipient Committee Campaign Statement). Once a campaign committee has raised or spent $2,000 or more it must file Form 460, which contains an overview of the committee’s activity during a specified period.</p>

<p>Oakland campaign committees file Form 460 with the Public Ethics Commission’s e-filing system, NetFile, which is available on the <a href="http://nf4.netfile.com/pub2/Default.aspx?aid=COAK&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Public Portal for Campaign Finance and Lobbyist Disclosure</a>. The raw data is also synced daily to the City of Oakland’s <a href="https://data.oaklandnet.com/">OakData portal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-up-to-date-is-the-data">How up-to-date is the data?</h2>

<p>The data is published to the site approximately every 24 hours. The data for
Open Disclosure is based on campaign finance <a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/campaign-rules/where-and-when-to-file-campaign-statements/when-to-file-campaign-statements-state-local-filing-schedules.html">filing deadlines</a> established by the
State of California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) for all state and
local elections.</p>

<p>The filing deadlines for local candidates and measures for:</p>

<p><strong>The November 5, 2024 election:</strong></p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In addition to these filing deadlines, contributions of $1,000 or more from
a single source made to candidate and ballot measure committees within the 90
days prior to the election must be reported within 24 hours.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-non-itemized-contribution-small-contribution">What is a non-itemized contribution (small contribution)?</h2>

<p>Candidate and ballot measure committees must report their total contributions regardless of size. However, contributions of $100 or more must be itemized and include additional information about the contributor. Contributions under $100 are reported in the aggregate.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-calculate-the-proportion-raised-within-oakland">How do you calculate the proportion raised within Oakland?</h2>

<p>Candidates and ballot measure committees must itemize contributions of $100 or more. Information includes the location of the individual, committee, or business making the contribution. The percentage is the proportion of contributions reported to be from Oakland divided by the total of the itemized contributions. We remove contributions and loans made by the candidate to their own campaign from this calculation.</p>

<h2 id="why-dont-the-total-contributions-presented-match-the-numbers-in-the-lists-of-itemized-contributions-by-location-and-category">Why don’t the total contributions presented match the numbers in the lists of itemized contributions by location and category?</h2>

<p>The total contributions and the itemized lists are calculated using different data sets. The total sums the total monetary and non-monetary contributions reported by each campaign committee at each filing deadline. The charts displaying contributions by location and category sum the itemized contributions filed, which are a sub-set of the total contributions. This leads to some discrepancies, because contributions under $100 are not required to be itemized with information on the donor’s identity and location.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-independent-expenditure">What is an Independent Expenditure?</h2>

<p>Political spending that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate or ballot measure but is not made in consultation, cooperation, or coordination with the candidate or campaign committee is termed an <a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_4/Manual_4_Ch_11_IE_Reporting.pdf">independent expenditure</a>. Under California law, any entity that makes independent expenditures of $1,000 or more per year to California candidates or ballot measures is subject to California campaign finance disclosure reporting requirements.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-contributions-calculated-for-committees-that-support-or-oppose-multiple-measures">How are contributions calculated for committees that support or oppose multiple measures?</h2>

<p>Data reported by committees formed to support or oppose multiple ballot measures is displayed in total and may include contributions and expenses to support or oppose other ballot measures. In cases where more than one ballot measure committee is formed to support or oppose a ballot measure, data may include transfers between committees. To view campaign statements visit <a href="https://public.netfile.com/pub2/Default.aspx?aid=COAK">Oakland’s public campaign finance portal</a></p>

<h2 id="what-other-types-of-committees-must-report-their-campaign-related-spending">What other types of committees must report their campaign-related spending?</h2>

<p>Committees that are not candidate-controlled or formed to support or oppose a particular candidate or ballot measure also raise funds and spend money in local elections. Under the Political Reform Act, committees that receive contributions or make expenditures to support or oppose multiple candidates and/or ballot measures must also file statements and reports on their activities just as candidate and ballot measure committees do. They must also report which candidate or ballot measure their expenditure is intended to support or oppose and whether the expenditure is a contribution to the campaign or an independent expenditure (see above). Independent expenditures are not included in the fundraising totals for candidates or ballot measures, but they are shown in a separate line item. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/campaign-rules.html">California Fair Political Practices Commission guide to Campaign Rules</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-were-ballot-measure-summaries-prepared">How were ballot measure summaries prepared?</h2>

<p>Ballot measure descriptions are intended to provide a brief, neutral summary. Summaries are written by Open Disclosure volunteers based on information prepared by the City Attorney for the <a href="https://www.acgov.org/rov/elections/20150317/documents/voter-information-en.pdf">Alameda County Official Voter Information Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-open-disclosure-endorse-third-party-content">Does Open Disclosure endorse third-party content?</h2>

<p>Open Disclosure contains links to various third party websites that contain additional information related to elections and the political process. Content linked to candidates, such as their campaign websites and social media, are not reviewed. Our site does not endorse, approve, certify, or control these external websites. We do not exercise editorial control or oversight over the content featured by these third-party sites and make no representation as to their accuracy, objectivity, fairness, completeness, efficacy, timeliness, or correct sequencing of information. We are not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any material available on or through such websites.We neither support nor oppose political parties, ballot measures, or candidates for public office.</p>

<h2 id="who-do-i-contact-if-i-believe-any-of-the-data-is-incorrect">Who do I contact if I believe any of the data is incorrect?</h2>

<p>Contact the <a href="https://github.com/caciviclab/odca-jekyll/issues/new?labels=type%2Fquestion&amp;title=Feedback%3A+a+question+on+data+correctness">Open Disclosure team</a> if you believe any of the data or candidate information is incorrect or violates the statement of impartiality outlined in the answer above. We want public feedback and ask to be notified if any errors are present. Thank you!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-oaklands-campaign-finance-rules">What are Oakland’s Campaign Finance Rules?</h2>

<p>Effective January 31, 2023, the limit for a contribution from a “person” is $600 for each candidate per election cycle. The limit for a contribution from a “broad-based political committee” is up to $1,200 to each candidate per election cycle (<a href="https://library.municode.com/HTML/16308/level3/TIT3MUEL_CH3.12THOACAREAC_ARTIIICOLI.html#TIT3MUEL_CH3.12THOACAREAC_ARTIIICOLI_3.12.050LICOPE">Oakland Campaign Reform Act (OCRA) 3.12.050</a>).</p>

<p>”Broad-based political committee” means a committee of persons which has been in existence for more than six months, receives contributions from one hundred (100) or more persons, and acting in concert makes contributions to five or more candidates (<a href="https://library.municode.com/HTML/16308/level3/TIT3MUEL_CH3.12THOACAREAC_ARTIIDE.html#TIT3MUEL_CH3.12THOACAREAC_ARTIIDE_3.12.040INAC">OCRA 3.12.040</a>).</p>
