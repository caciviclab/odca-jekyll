title: About the Open Disclosure California Project
---
The Open Disclosure California (ODCA) project is California’s first online repository combining local and state campaign finance data. This first phase of ODCA includes all campaign finance activity for the November 2016 election in the city of Oakland. We track contributions to Oakland candidates and ballot measures and their expenditures to offer voters the full story of money in this year’s election. This is just the second phase of a larger initiative to offer local campaign finance data statewide. The first phase visualized money in the [2014 Oakland mayoral election](http://2014.opendisclosure.io/).

## The Future of ODCA

ODCA will combine campaign finance data from local cities and counties with state-level data to create a more comprehensive picture of who is influencing local elections in a user-friendly online experience with the voting public in mind. We want to make this local campaign contribution and spending data easier to find, see, search, and understand. 

The goal is to build an automated pipeline from existing data sources that feeds up-to-date state and local campaign finance data into our system. A free, open API will allow others to use this data for their own projects. A website will present the data on all races and ballot measures for local jurisdictions that have their data loaded into our system, as well as statewide races. 

By feeding local and state data into our system, we can better connect the campaign finance dots and provide important context as to the big players influencing elections. The accompanying website will offer rich visualizations to better allow the voting public to conceptualize campaign spending in their communities. Interested parties who wish to dig deeper into the actual data will be able to do so for their own projects.

Disclosure of campaign finance empowers citizens and strengthens democracy by keeping government accountable by revealing influential connections, the flow of money in politics, and potential issues with how campaign funds are raised and spent. Open Disclosure’s goal is to provide needed clarity and transparency to local campaign money and to supply the public with insight on local politics to make an educated choice on election day. 

## About the Team

The Open Disclosure team is a group of volunteer civic hackers that include developers, data scientists, policy wonks, civic workers, designers, and journalists working to promote government integrity and transparency in campaign activities by promoting the exposure and visibility of campaign finance data. 

In 2014, several Code for America brigade project teams from across California joined forces to establish [California Civic Lab](http://caciviclab.org/), a partnership organization to build Open Disclosure California (ODCA). Early members of California Civic Lab came from Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. ODCA could not succeed without the guidance and support from their partnership with the [Oakland Public Ethics Commission](http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/CityAdministration/d/PublicEthics/index.htm). 

All development on OpenDisclosure happens publicly on
[Github](https://github.com/caciviclab/disclosure-frontend). We invite any
questions or suggestions for improvement–just [create an issue on
Github](https://github.com/caciviclab/disclosure-frontend/issues/new?labels=type%2Fquestion)!
